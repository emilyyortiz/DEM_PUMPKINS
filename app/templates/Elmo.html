        <p>Guys. Cookie Monster is soo rude. Today Elmo baked a batch of fresh cookies, 
            and right when Elmo took them out of the oven, Cookie Monster came by and stole the whole tray.
            I hate him.</p>

        <p> I was kidnapped to be cookie monster in a costume. Someone save me from this. I really want to see my 
            family and friends but I need to act for the dumb kids FOR MY WHOLE LIFETIME!.</p>
